LAS2peer-Chat-Service
=====================

The folder "frontend" contains a web frontend to interact with the service (to "chat").  
One can either connect with an "empty" node to a running LAS2peer instance hosting this service
or create an own service instance, in both ways a user can join the common "chatroom"-lobby.  
The folder scripts contains a start script.
The "b" scripts have to be executed in the correct order to work properly.
